1 - Introduction

    This project is an exercise proposed in the Fullstack JS module, where the teacher asked us to implement the chaotic codebase developed in the 'original_main.js' script into a more robust, reliable and easy-to-read solution by using Javascript modules and Vite as build tool.

2 - Project components

    The project is a simple single-page with some sections:
        - header section
        - banner section
        - form section
        - button section (api request with axios)

3 - Modules used for each section

    - header: setLetter;
    - banner: banners, buildbanners, removebanner;
    - form: check_email, check_username, formvalidation;
    - button: getdata, buildtable, managemouse
